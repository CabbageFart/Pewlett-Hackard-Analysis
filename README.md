# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

  The goal of this project was to determine just how big the the oncoming "silver tsunami" would be. The first table we would create was to find exatly how many employees were about to retire. The second table was a quite clever analysis of which employees would be best suited to be mentors for the new hires that are to come.
  
## Results
  * We imported all the data available to us and got to work. After doing a search in several tables we were able to create a list of all employees about to retire. We saw immediatly that the "silver tsunami" was very real.

  * Once we realized how big the number was we knew we would need a count by 
department to help the managers know what they would be facing.

  * With this many openings about to be available, a mentorship program is 100% necessary. Back to the tables we went. This time we would adjust our search to find the employees who would have the most experience to draw upon.

  * The cost for the retirement parties will be massive.

## Summary
  There are 72458 employees about to retire and only 1549 employees were found suitable to be mentors. The Mentorship Program should begin post haste by filling the upper lvls of managment and working our way down. By doing this you will get more people suitable to train entry level employees as they come on board.
  In order to find the most suitable mentor for a position we created a query that can be used to find a particular position. This should make the mentor assignment easier.

Due to the large amount of positions needed to be filled we thought a new table would be needed to avoid any conflicts between gender salaries.
